 * This is a class that records the livetime of an object. When we first see an object,
 * we create it's livetime. We assume that it is not born at its first occurence
 * as we leave the possibility for preaccess. Everytime an object changes it's 
 * state, the booleans born, live and dead must be changed accordingly.
